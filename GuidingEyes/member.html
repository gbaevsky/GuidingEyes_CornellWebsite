    <h3> How to Become A Sitter </h3>

    <p> To become a sitter, you must show interest in our events by going to as many as you can.  At the beginning of each semester, Eboard will look at the individuals who have been to the most events and have demonstrated interest in becoming a sitter.  They will then go through a short interview process.  Following the interview process, they will attend national training classes including Pre-Puppy Placement Class (PPPC) and a Campus Community Workshop (CCW).  They must also complete 3 shadow hours with Eboard and/or Raisers.  </p>

    <h3> How to Become A Raiser </h3>

    <p> An individual must first go through the entire sitter process.  Its often customary to sit for an entire semester then email the Regional Manager (RM) to express interest in raising. </p>
