      <h2> National Organization </h2>

      <h4> Our Mission Statement: </h4>
        <p>
          Guiding Eyes for the Blind provides guide dogs to people with vision loss.  We are passionate about connecting exceptional dogs with individuals for greater independence.
        </p>

      <h4>Who we are: </h4>
        <p>
          Guiding Eyes for the Blind is dedicated to creating and supporting life-changing connections. Since our founding by Donald Kauth in 1954, we’ve graduated almost 10,000 teams. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with all services provided completely free of charge.  At Guiding Eyes, we rely upon the contributions of our generous donors to fulfill our mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guiding Eyes is an accredited member of the International Guide Dog Federation (IGDF), the organization that establishes worldwide standards for the breeding and training of guide dogs. We’re proud to support their mission to improve and uphold worldwide standards for the breeding and training of guide dogs. Guiding Eyes also partners with other organizations, to ensure that exceptional dogs who are not suited to guide work, may go on to alternative careers in detection or as service dogs, or are placed in loving homes through our Youth Program or public adoption.

      <h2> Finger Lakes Region </h2>

      <p>
        The Finger Lakes Region is home to dozens of volunteer puppy raisers, working under the guidance of Guiding Eyes for the Blind in Yorktown Heights, New York. The organization has provided guide dogs for the visually impaired since 1954, and is an accredited member of the International Guide Dog Federation, which establishes worldwide standards for the breeding and training of guide dogs. Volunteer puppy raisers are the first step in this process – they provide the necessary foundation of early training and love that allows a puppy to grow to become an adult guide dog.

      <h4> A Message from the Founder of the Cornell Chapter - Frances Chen </h4>
        <p>
          When I came to Cornell as an undergrad, I found out that they had Guiding Eyes for the Blind here as a region, and then I started to get involved just when Guiding Eyes was really starting to make a presence on the Cornell campus. We came together with other students and started Guiding Eyes for the Blind at Cornell. Guiding Eyes for the Blind at Cornell is an undergraduate organization that takes these guide dog puppies in training and allows undergraduates to get involved, taking these dogs to classes, taking them on long walks, and basically helping socialize our puppies.
        </p>
        <p>
          So as puppy sitters, we're not necessarily responsible for a single dog. We help raise all the dogs in the region by exposing them to extra socialization opportunities. And as you can imagine, the college campus, both within the College of Veterinary Medicine and the greater Cornell campus, provides a lot of different opportunities for these puppies to see a lot of different sights, walk on different surfaces, be exposed to a lot of different smells and people. And so it's proven really beneficial to everyone, because our puppies obviously get the benefit of that training, but our vet students and undergrads also learn a lot about dog behavior.
        </p>
