# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Work together to create a functional website for our client
    - Have the Milestones finished by Tuesday night
    - actively communicating to stay on task
    - organize who is working on what parts of the project when and when they need to get done by

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    - Let group members know when you are working on the project
    - Let group members know when you plan on completing a task for the overall Project
    - Do not wait until the last minute to complete a task that needs to be done for the group
    - Actively communicate with the group in the chat when you are confused about something or need help with a task

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - we will communicate on text in a group chat and our main meetings will be at the lab section
    - we will communicate daily to update each other on what we have completed

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - Meet with client on zoom, on the phone, or in person

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    - (for now - we will alter as we go) every person in the group will complete their assigned page and look over the other pages to make sure the design is cohesive throughout the website
    - submitter: each week some one will submit the assignment using the submission link and check with the group before to make sure that we are all on board with the submission

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We will hold ourselves and teammates accountable by being active on the group chat and if a team member fails to deliver what is promised we will text them and if needed, set up a group meeting to ensure tasks get done and possibly adjust tasks among members.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    When we disagree, we will do user testing to see what design is best for the users and how we can best accomplish their goals

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    If anyone feels like a change in contract is needed, they should bring it up at a team meeting, and a vote can be held on whether we would like to adopt the change. 3 out of 4 members have to agree for the contract to be amended.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    - At the end of the project we celebrate


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
