# Group Project: Design Journey

**You are encouraged to work ahead on everything on this project.** (Though we suggest you hold back on the interactivity until Project 3.) **Each section is required for a specific milestone. You are required to have these sections completed before that milestone's deadline.**

**Be clear and concise in your writing.** Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.

## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Guiding Eyes for the Blind is a national organization that trains dogs to eventually become service dogs for the visually impaired.  The Cornell chapter of Guiding Eyes is a part of the Finger Lakes Region of the national organization.  At Cornell, Guiding Eyes educates students and faculty to become their own puppy raiser and sitter.  The purpose of the raisers and sitters is to train the puppies for the first one to two years of their lives.  The puppies then take a test to judge whether they are fit for the formal training program after leaving Cornell.

Guiding Eyes also host events with other organizations on campus to both expose the puppies-in-training to new environments and to increase awareness of raising guide dogs within the Cornell community.

The client meets the requirements of the project as they are an organization on campus that no member of the team has any membership or close relation with.  They do not currently have their own website and are looking for one to satisfy the goals listed below.


## Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants. Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page.) Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

Guiding Eyes at Cornell does not currently have their own website and they rely on the national organization's website to get out their information. They want their website to describe them and who they are as a chapter of Guiding Eyes. This includes how people can get more involved, what they do at Cornell and in the finger lakes region, and information about them and the dogs. They have a lot of information on past and present dogs and they are looking to share that information with the public through their website. Guiding Eyes's audience for their website is Cornell students and possibly faculty, so the website must appeal to the average college student.


## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> Your project should be ambitious, but not too large. A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big. Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

The website we will create for our client has enough information to put on about 4 pages, but it will not exceed that.  The client has 5 main goals that, in order to accomplish them, do not need content for more than a page.  For example, one of the client's goals is to have their audience be able to contact them and contact information can be fit with other content on a page.  On the other hand, the website will not be too small because most of their goals require enough content for an entire page and a general home/about page can be added as well.  Because this website is designed mainly for students and faculty trying to learn more about the club and trying to get more involved, the page is meant to be informative but also straight to the point so that students can determine if they want to join and how they can join.  Therefore, the website is the right size for this project.  


## Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal A: Present information about past and present dogs who went through their training program
- Goal B: Tell people how they can get involved in Guiding Eyes - how someone can become a puppy sitter and/or raiser
- Goal C: How to contact them
- Goal D: Calendar with upcoming events
- Goal E: Help people understand who the organization is and what they do on campus themselves and with other campus organizations

# Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!

- we will get a basic layout with majority of content on the website done by the time the second milestone needs to be done to complete user testing
- milestone 2 due 11/17 so have rough draft with all pages of website completed by 11/12 to give ample time to test
- user testing done with milestone 2 by 11/16 to make sure it is all set by the due date (11/17)
- finalize everything that is completed by 11/27 so we have a couple of days to work out any kinks that may have arisen in the final stages



# Site Design/Plan (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience. Be specific and justify why this audience is a cohesive group with regard to your client's site. This audience should not be overly broad nor arbitrarily specific. It should be a cohesive group with similar _goals_.

Our site's audience is Cornell students who would want to get involved in Guiding Eyes or just get to know about the program. This website for Cornell's chapter of Guiding Eyes is a place students can go to find out information about the dogs and how to get involved. Cornell students are their target audience as they hope to expand on campus and attract new members.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project I am (re-)designing a web site for _Guiding Eyes_.

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above. List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Describe the Purpose of the Chapter and its Affiliation with the National Organization
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We will include a brief description of what Guiding Eyes (the national organization) aims to do and another description of how this relates to the goals of the Cornell chapter.  We will explain their purpose of training dogs to become future service animals.  
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Most of our users from our interviews knew very little about what the national organization actually was other than the fact that they help to train service dogs.  This goal aims to help clarify to these users what more the Cornell Chapter has to offer and other goals beyond training the dogs.  This will also help our client's goal (E) described above about clarifying their identity on campus.

Goal 2: To Connect Individuals with the Club's Events and to Connect with Other Organizations on Campus to Create Combined Events
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We will include a calendar of their future events on our site to inform users of when and where they will take place.  We will also include contact information so other organizations can book events with them including Pet-A-Puppy, an event where Guiding Eyes brings puppies to another organization's event.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This satisfies the client's goal (D) described above.  Guiding Eyes wants to help students understand where and when they can attend events for the chapter to learn more about the organization and their involvement.  This also helps to clarify the confusion discovered above in the user interviews about finding their event calendar.

Goal 3: How Individuals Can Become Involved with the Organization
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
 - We will include contact information to so users can reach out to the eboard and other members of the chapter.  We will also include textual information about the different positions students can do to get involved with including eboard positions, general membership, and puppy raisers and sitters.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This satisfies the client's goal (B) described above about how people can get involved.  Since the process to become a part of the some of these positions can often be very long, we wanted to inform users of both small, fast ways to become involved as well as more long-term, time-consuming positions that may not be for everyone.

Goal 4: Contacting the Organization
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We will provide a clear section with the organizations email and social media to allow users to contact the organization as they wish. We will also provide the contact information of certain members of the club that they can reach out to if needed. Design wise, we will use a clear title labeling the contact information section and put the information in a visible and intuitive location on the website.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Simply, the easiest way to help users contact the information is by providing it on the site. The title will help make this information easy to find and allow the users to quickly accomplish their goal.


## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

**Plan your site's content.**

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List the content you plan to include your personal website. This should be a comprehensive list.

- information about Guiding Eyes as a national organization
- involvement in the Finger Lakes Regional Chapter
- more specific information about the Cornell chapter
- meeting times
- time of future events
- location of future events
- how to get involved
- how to become a sitter or raiser for the organization
- images of past and present service dogs raised at Cornell
- descriptions of the past and present service dogs
- how other people and organizations at Cornell can book events with Guiding Eyes
 - contact Information
 - team member contact information
 - positions you can hold
 - link to national website

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how its addressed their goals..

This content is right for the site's audience because it provides them with the information we determined they want from a website for an extracurricular activity during the user interviews. This content allows us to create a multipage website in which each page has content for different goals. We will have a page designated to providing the user with the information about Guiding Eyes and their goals. During the interviews, it was a common answer that the users wanted to know about the organization and would look for information about their goals for the club. We will also have information about how to get involved because most people had not accessed information about Guiding Eyes before and want to know more. We will also have more information about dates and times of events because there are many different ways to get involved with Guiding Eyes. This content provides the audience with information that is both general to the public and specific to the students to get involved and learn about the organization.



## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your iterations of card sorting here.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting and description of your thought process for each iteration.

![Iteration 1](/design/IMG_9959.jpg)
For the first iteration, the first group consists of content that provides general information about the guiding eyes organization.  This includes information about the dogs and the organization inside and outside of cornell.  The second group consists of information about events that students or people who want to get involved would want to know.  The third group has information for getting directly involved by contacting specifc members and booking events for other organizatins.  The last category contains information that lets people know the different options of getting involved and next steps.
![Iteration 2](/design/IMG_9961.jpg)
This second iteration divides the content into three groups, where first one is very general information and contact information to the organization.  The dog information and pictures was removed from this group because it seemed more specific for the cornell chapter and this group contains information about guiding eyes in general.  The second grouping has content that is related to events including when and where events are taking place and how to schedule events.  The last grouping has content that deals with general getting involved information and entices people to get involved with information about the dogs and images.
![Iteration 3](/design/IMG_9960.jpg)
The third iteration has four groups.  The first group does not have the contact information like the second iteration because the other content is more focused on general information about guiding eyes so it just has information about the organization at the cornell chapter, fingerlakes, and as a national organizaiton.  The second group is all about events and getting in contact.  All the content provides information if you want to know anything about events.  The third group is all about the service dogs, including images and descriptions of past and present dogs.  This information is surrounding all around the dogs.  The fourth group has information about membership and next steps to get involved, including member information and contact information, positions, how to get involved as a sitter/raiser, etc.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

Iteration 3

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences and their goals.

The final organization is appropriate for the site's audience of Cornell students who want to get involved or learn more about guiding eyes and their goals.  The first group of general information about the guiding eyes organization caters to the audience's goal of understanding the chapter and the relationship to the national chapter by providing all the chapter and organization information.  Another goal of the audience is to learn about the club's events and how to set up events with other organizations.  The content in the second group provides all the information about events and booking events with guiding eyes.  Another goal, how to get involed in the organization is provided in the group about membership and getting involved as there is direct information about the ways to get involved.  Finally, the audience's goal of contacting the organization is in both the events group to book events and in the membership group, where specific team member contact information would be listed.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your personal website navigation.

- About Guiding Eyes - general information about Guiding Eyes
- Meet the Dogs - images of the Dogs
- Events - going to events, booking events with them, contact information
- Membership - how to get involved

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience and their goals.

These page names are very descriptive of the content that is on each of the pages. They provide places for each piece of information that was a goal for the users. The information is easily accesbile for the different goals. For example, if another organization wants to book an event with Guiding Eyes, they would go to the event page and fidn out how to book an event with the organization.


## Design (Milestone 2)

### Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.
> Note the theme you selected for you site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

1. Clean cut theme, colors are the same as the guiding eyes logo (blue, white, blue, gray), simple design, wholesome
    - appropriate for the audience because it is a site about dogs which is heartwarming and people want to visit a site that is well organized while also giving them a good feeling about the organization
2. Vibrant bubbly theme, bright colors, curved edges and font
    - target audience is looking to join or learn more about guiding eyes - vibrant theme will make the club appear fun and energetic and may attract people to join.


### Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 2)
> Brainstorm several ideas for your site's interactivity.
> Provide a very brief summary how each idea improves the usability of the site for the site's audience.

1. Carousel for the "Meet the Dogs" page to showcase the different dogs
    - this works better for the goals of the client because there are different categories for the dogs
2. Gallery for the "Meet the Dogs" page to show all of the dogs at once and then focus on one
    - this looks cool but is not the best for the purpose of this page
3. Hamburger menu for mobile version of the website.
    - this will help provide more space for the mobile version of the site.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the mobile and desktop versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![Layout Exploration](/design/layouts.jpg)
Both desktop designs are very similar, but the first one follows a very familiar approach with the company logo/name next to the navigation bar at the top of the page. The second design makes the header more vertical and pushes some of the content to be in rows which is also a familiar design and can work with this website's purpose. These design patterns are easily recognizable which is very useful in a website.
The mobile designs are also similar and are both familiar. The first one is more common and more visually appealing for this content because the page names are longer than one word. The second one is a little cramped but would keep everything compact so the user can see more of the content.

### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 2)
> Explain and/or provide annotated sketches of the interactivity you will implement for your site.
> Explain how the interactivity improves the usability of the site and helps the site's audiences meet their goals.

- We will have 3 carousels on the "Meet the Dogs" page for the current dogs, working dogs, and the released dogs. Each of these carousels will have images of the dogs in that category with small descriptions about each dog when that image is displayed.
- We will have a hamburger menu for the mobile version of the site to provide additional limited space for the user so that they are able to see the main content of the page they are on.

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for **each** of your site's pages.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Provide a explanation for each sketch.

**Desktop and Mobile Designs:**
![About Guidings Eyes](/design/about-ge.jpg)
Lays out the information in a logical way that is easy to follow and provides the user with the expected information. The mobile design is similar to the desktop except it stacks information on top of each other where it may have been next to each other.
![Events](/design/events-ge.jpg)
The events page puts the desired information in an order that makes sense. The Google Calendar is a perfect thing to have next to the other information because it balances it out and puts the text in a visual image plus more information. Once again, the mobile design is similar to that of the about page because it stacks the information on top of one another.
![Meet the Dogs](/design/meet-dogs-new.jpg)
The meet the dogs page is a showcase of the different dogs they have raised as a chapter, so the carousels make perfect sense. There are different categories of dogs and each one will be featured in its own carousel to divide up the images. The mobile design makes the carousels smaller, but follows the same principles.
![Membership](/design/membership-ge.jpg)
The membership page gives the information about how to get involved and what you can do. The design is simple, but gets the information to the users which was a big part of the goals expressed in the user interviews.


### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience. Specially, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users? How did you employ design patterns to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

The design is appropriate for our audience of Cornell students because it gives them an organized platform to find information about Guiding Eyes. The site's design is very clean cut and organized which was appealing to users in the user interviews. The design meets the goals of the users through the navigation and the interactivity. The navigation lays out where the user can find their desired information and the interactivity makes it more interactive and clean cut more images. One of the main features that draws users to Guiding Eyes is puppies and our interactivity is meant to highlight that part with the gallery that will be implemented to show the picture of the dog and a small description.



## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the elements, any CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

```
Carousel:
Each of the following classes of elements will have their own carousel, but will follow the same CSS classes, events, psuedocode, and basic inital states:

#left-arrow(1)(2)(3) - button
#right-arrow(1)(2)(3) - button
.current-dogs - div
.working-dogs - div
.released-dogs - div
.carousel-dots(1)(2)(3)
.dot(1)(2)(3)

CSS classes:
.hidden - add and remove from slides
.active - add and remove from current

Pseudocode:
when #left-arrow is clicked
    add .hidden class to the current slide
    remove .hidden class from the previous slide

when #right-arrow is clicked
    add .hidden class to the current slide
    remove .hidden class from the next slide

when #dot1(1)(2)(3) is clicked
    add .hidden class to all slides
    remove .hidden class from the first slide
    add .active class to current dot

when #dot2(1)(2)(3) is clicked
    add .hidden class to all slides
    remove .hidden class from the second slide
    add .active class to current dot

(this pertains to each dot respectively - each carousel has a different number of dots pertaining to the different number of slides in each)

Initial states:
All images in the carousel aside from the first one will have the hidden class

All slide dot indicators with not have the active class unless it is the dot pertaining to the first slide in each carousel


Hamburger menu:
#nav-bar-button - button
#nav-bar-content - nav
.nav-bar - nav
.button-bar - div

CSS classes:
.hidden - add and remove nav bar elements

Pseudocode:
when the document loads:
    when .nav-bar-button is clicked:
      if #nav-bar-content has class .hidden:
        remove .hidden class from #nav-bar-content
      otherwise,
        add .hidden to the #nav-bar-content

if the window width is greater than or equal to 760:
  remove .hidden class from #nav-bar-contents
  otherwise,
  add .hidden class to #nav-bar-contents

```


## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)
> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

Client Feedback:
- add more images so its not so wordy
- space out the wording more in the sections that appear to have bullet points so its more readble
- overall really liked the design


# Evaluation (Final Submission)

## Finished Desktop & Mobile Website (Final Submission)
> Include screenshots of both the desktop and mobile version of your site that you will be using for user testing. (We need to see the "before" testing version of your site.)
> Use the FireFox screenshot feature to take screenshots of the entire page.

## User Testing (Final Submission)

**Conduct user testing with a minimum of 4 participants.**

### User Testing Tasks (Final Submission)
> Plan out your user testing tasks before doing your user testing. These must be actual user testing tasks. **Tasks are not questions!**

1. You are interested in hosting an event with Guiding Eyes for a club you are in. Find the information you need to make this partnership happen.

2. Your friend is a raiser in Guiding Eyes but you forgot which dog is his. Find which dog belongs to Matt Roohan.

3. You want to get involved in Guiding Eyes at Cornell and possibly become a raiser, but you are not sure how to do that. Find the information on how to become a puppy raiser.

    - There is a lot of information on the website so at first glance it may have been intimidating but the clear nature of the navigation bar helps guide users to the right place.

    - Having a lot of information on the first page made this user be inefficient.

## Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

- at the top of the About Guiding Eyes page, include information about the content featured below - a little message about what a user can find when looking at this page as there is a lot of text on it
- include an information message above the carousels instructing the user to scroll through to see more dogs that fall under that specific category (an extra affordance to the user to make the feature clearer)
- move Eboard position information from the Membership page to the Cornell section of the About Guiding Eyes page
- make some of the images slightly smaller so the text below it is visible without having to scroll down a lot
- adding a note mentioning that there is more information on how to become a sitter and raiser below the sections titled "Become a Dog Sitter/Raiser"


## Final Notes to the Graders (Final Submission)
> 1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.

One strength of our website is its ability to compile a large amount of content in an effective manner. Through our user tests, it became clear that there is a wide array of information that can be easily accessed through our website. Overall, the strong design of our website enables a concise and clear presentation of information. An other strength is our interactivity which further enhances our display of information and navigation system. Specifically, our carousels allow us to display the numerous dogs in a natural way which keeps the page from being cramped. On our mobile version, the hamburger menu is able to maintain a concise design while keeping all our pages easily accessible. Finally, our website sets itself apart by following design best practices. From the color to the picture layout, everything on the website was carefully thought through with the user experience in mind. For our carousel's for example, we made sure to have clear affordances such as large, dark arrows and carousel place markers under the content.

> 2. Tell us what you, as a team, learned while working on this project.

As a team, we learned how to complete a website creation project in unison. Prior to this project, we didn't have much experience coordinating this sort of project through Atom and github. Not only did we have to be effective communicators, but we also had to learn the nuances of merge our work together into one repository. We were able to do successfully do this by first meeting in person and completing work in the same room. With time, we learned to be communicative and were able to successfully complete the project remotely.

> 3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.

Nick Nejadnik did the final 3 user tests and the final notes, but his atom was not letting him push to GitHub, so I am copying in his information. Otherwise, we greatly enjoyed working as a team and creating this website for our client. We hope you enjoy viewing it as well!
